      To determine if GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of subjects with chronic ITP to a
      threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published response &gt;60%.  Also to assess the
      safety of GAMMAPLEX and determine if platelet counts are maintained at 50 x 109/L in

      The primary objective is to determine if BPL's GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of
      subjects with chronic ITP to a threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published
      response &gt;60%.  The secondary objectives are:  1) to determine the safety of GAMMAPLEX at
      the dosage used in this study.  2) to determine if GAMMAPLEX maintains platelet counts of ³
      50 x 109/L in subjects with chronic ITP for a period of time similar to that of a published
      data.

The first course of GAMMAPLEX will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 1 g/kg on each of 2 consecutive days. If required, a further 1 or 2 courses on the same dosage regimen may be administered in the period Day 32 to Day 90 following the first course of GAMMAPLEX.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged between 18 and 70 years.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of chronic ITP of at least 6 months duration.

          3. Platelet count of less than or equal to 20 x 10 9/L at enrollment.

             been stable (for a minimum of 2 weeks before screening).  The dose of corticosteriod
             or other immunosuppressant should have remained constant until Day 32. 6) If subjects
             were being treated with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or attenuated androgens, the

        <description>The safety variables used to assess safety were the following:
Adverse events
The number and percent of infusions with at least 1 adverse event(AE) that occurs during an infusion or within 72 hours after the infusion stops
Nature, severity, and frequency of AEs
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)
Vital signs
Clinical laboratory tests and Direct Coombs’ Test
Transmission of viruses
Physical examination</description>
        <time_frame>AEs were documented from the date the informed consent form was signed until the End of Study visit on Day 90.</time_frame>
