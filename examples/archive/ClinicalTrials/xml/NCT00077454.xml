    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib when given with
      temozolomide in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Erlotinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving erlotinib with temozolomide may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in children with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug alone and with temozolomide in
      these patients.

      III. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are
      stratified according to pretreatment (heavily pretreated [received more than 2 prior
      multiagent myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens OR received prior craniospinal or pelvic
      radiotherapy or bone marrow transplantation OR has bone marrow involvement] vs less heavily
      pretreated).Part 1:

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Beginning with course 2, patients
      also receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 23 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib during course 1 only until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Part 2: Patients receive erlotinib (at the MTD) and temozolomide as in part 1.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-45 patients (9-24 for part 1 and up to 21 for part 2) will
      be accrued for this study.
