  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of
      a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by
      the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized
      structures called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen
      accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which
      prevents their normal function. The overall objective is to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of alglucosidase alfa treatment in patients with late-onset Pompe
      disease as compared to placebo.

    <description>Overall safety summary of patients experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), treatment-related AEs, and Infusion Associated Reactions (IARs).  Summary is based on Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as AEs that occurred following the initiation of study treatment, i.e., alglucosidase alfa or placebo.</description>

    <description>Mean distance walked gives an indication of functional endurance.  The greater the distance, the greater the endurance.  Mean values of distance walked in a six-minute walk test are offered for baseline, week 78 (or last available observation), and the mean change from baseline (at week 78 or last available post-baseline observation).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Forced vital capacity is a standard pulmonary function test used to quantify respiratory muscle weakness. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration in the upright position, measured in liters. Predicted forced vital capacity is based on a formula using sex, age and height of a person, and is an estimate of healthy lung capacity. Percent of predicted FVC = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%.</description>

    <time_frame>weeks 0, 78</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Quantitative muscle testing (QMT) is a standardized system to measure muscle force production during maximal voluntary isometric contraction. QMT data were collected directly from sensors into laptop computers. Predicted normal values for QMT are based on a formula using sex, age and body mass index of a person, and is an estimate of healthy muscle force. Percent of predicted QMT = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%. The QMT Leg Score is the average of the bilateral means for percent predicted knee flexors and extensors. A value of 100% indicates 'normal' muscle strength.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOS SF)-36 questionnaire consists of 36 items grouped into 8 domains designed to assess generic health-related quality of life in healthy and ill adult populations. Physical Component Scores (PCS) report the four domains of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. Higher scores are associated with better quality of life. All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible.  The PCS scores are reported.</description>

Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration in the upright position, measured in liters. Predicted forced vital capacity is based on a formula using sex, age and height of a person, and is an estimate of healthy lung capacity. Percent of predicted FVC = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%.</description>

        <title>Percent Predicted Proximal Muscle Strength of the Lower Limbs as Measured by Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT)</title>
        <description>Quantitative muscle testing (QMT) is a standardized system to measure muscle force production during maximal voluntary isometric contraction. QMT data were collected directly from sensors into laptop computers. Predicted normal values for QMT are based on a formula using sex, age and body mass index of a person, and is an estimate of healthy muscle force. Percent of predicted QMT = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%. The QMT Leg Score is the average of the bilateral means for percent predicted knee flexors and extensors. A value of 100% indicates 'normal' muscle strength.</description>

Physical Component Scores (PCS) report the four domains of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. Higher scores are associated with better quality of life. All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible.  The PCS scores are reported.</description>
