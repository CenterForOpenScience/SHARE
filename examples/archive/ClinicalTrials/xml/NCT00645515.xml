  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety of ziprasidone and risperidone for the
      treatment of chronic schizophrenia.  The primary purpose is to differentiate the effects of
      ziprasidone and risperidone on extrapyramidal side effects and the secondary purpose is to
      compare their tolerability and efficacy.
