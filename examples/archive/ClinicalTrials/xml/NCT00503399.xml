    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that teriparatide is superior to the
      active comparator in the change from baseline to 18 months of lumbar spine volumetric
      trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in males with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multinational, European, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active
      comparator controlled study with 2 study periods: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, and an
      open-label treatment phase of 18 months. Approximately 100 adult men with osteoporosis
      associated with sustained glucocorticoid therapy will be enrolled into the study.
      Approximately one-half of the participants (at all investigational sites) will be randomized
      to teriparatide 20 micrograms/day (ug/day given as a subcutaneous (sc) injection), and the
      other half randomized to risedronate 35 milligrams (mg) once weekly (QW) oral (po) tablet.
      All participants will receive approximately 1000 mg/day elemental calcium and 800 to 1200
      international units per day (IU/day) of vitamin D.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure variables of T12 were assessed by HR-QCT. In contrast with regular QCT that assessed 3 millimeter (mm) slide thickness, HR-QCT used segmentation of 1 single vertebra with approximately 100 consecutive slides reconstructed at 300-400 micrometer (µm) slice increments covering the complete vertebral body. Least Squares (LS) Means were adjusted for age, baseline P1NP, fracture less than 12 months before study start, duration of prior bisphosphonate use, screening glucocorticoid dose, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose before and during the trial.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Anterior bending and axial torsion were measured using HR-QCT-based finite element analysis to determine stiffness and strength of T12. Stiffness evaluated strength of the vertebral body, defined as the slope of the initial step of the force-displacement curve. Strength of the vertebral body was evaluated under compressive loading conditions using computer simulation. LS Means were adjusted for age, baseline P1NP, fracture less than 12 months before study start, duration of prior bisphosphonate use, screening glucocorticoid dose, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose before and during the trial.</description>

Fractures that occurred during the study were collected separately as an additional safety variable. The number of participants experiencing hypercalcemia was summarized for each treatment arm. Hypercalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level corrected for albumin of &gt;2.7 millimole per liter (mmol/L) (10.8 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]).</description>

        <description>Three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure variables of T12 were assessed by HR-QCT. In contrast with regular QCT that assessed 3 millimeter (mm) slide thickness, HR-QCT used segmentation of 1 single vertebra with approximately 100 consecutive slides reconstructed at 300-400 micrometer (µm) slice increments covering the complete vertebral body. Least Squares (LS) Means were adjusted for age, baseline P1NP, fracture less than 12 months before study start, duration of prior bisphosphonate use, screening glucocorticoid dose, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose before and during the trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Anterior Bending and Axial Torsion by Finite Element Analysis in the 12th Thoracic Vertebra (T12) at 6 Months and 18 Months: Stiffness and Strength</title>
        <description>Anterior bending and axial torsion were measured using HR-QCT-based finite element analysis to determine stiffness and strength of T12. Stiffness evaluated strength of the vertebral body, defined as the slope of the initial step of the force-displacement curve. Strength of the vertebral body was evaluated under compressive loading conditions using computer simulation. LS Means were adjusted for age, baseline P1NP, fracture less than 12 months before study start, duration of prior bisphosphonate use, screening glucocorticoid dose, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose before and during the trial.</description>
