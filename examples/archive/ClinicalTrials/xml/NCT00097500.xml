      This Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study is designed to compare the effects of exenatide
      and insulin glargine (Lantus® injection) on beta-cell function in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus using metformin.

    <description>Treatment effect on beta-cell function as measured by the ratio of Week 52 arginine-stimulated insulin secretion during a hyperglycemic clamp(specifically, the incremental AUC of insulin with respect to basal value over a 10 min period [i.e., clamp time 290 min to 300 min]) to that at baseline (i.e., the ratio is calculated as arginine-stimulated insulin secretion at week 52 divided by arginine-stimulated insulin secretion at baseline [week -2]).</description>

    <description>Ratio of first phase C-peptide response to glucose at 52 weeks (end of on-drug period) and 56 weeks (during off-drug period) compared to first phase C-peptide response to glucose at baseline (i.e., C-peptide response to glucose at week 52 or week 56 divided by C-peptide response to glucose at baseline [week -2]).  C-peptide is measured as a surrogate marker of insulin secretion.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>M-value at baseline (week -2), week 52 (end of on-drug period), and week 56 (during off-drug period).  Insulin sensitivity was assessed during the euglycemic/hyperglycemic clamp test at baseline (week -2), week 52, and week 56.  Insulin-mediated glucose uptake (M-value) was calculated as the mean glucose requirement during the 90-120 minute interval of the clamp.</description>

        <description>M-value at baseline (week -2), week 52 (end of on-drug period), and week 56 (during off-drug period).  Insulin sensitivity was assessed during the euglycemic/hyperglycemic clamp test at baseline (week -2), week 52, and week 56.  Insulin-mediated glucose uptake (M-value) was calculated as the mean glucose requirement during the 90-120 minute interval of the clamp.</description>
