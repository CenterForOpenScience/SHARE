        Inclusion criteria

        Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion.  Patients must meet all of the following
        inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study:

          1. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of less than 7 years characterized as
             Stage I-III by the Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale and with a maximum of 6 months
             cumulative lifetime exposure to levodopa and/or dopamine agonist.  Patients on
             current dopamine agonist therapy would require 14-day washout.

          2. Age at least 30 years.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-HCG pregnancy test at
             the Screen (Baseline) visit and the patient must use adequate contraceptive methods.

          4. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the patient (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of  all
             pertinent aspects of the study.

          5. Patients who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             and other study procedures.

        Exclusion criteria

        Main criteria for exclusion. The presence of any of the following would make a patient

          9. Congestive heart failure, Class III or IV

         10. Unstable heart disease such as unstable angina, dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction

         12. Clinically significant liver disease or renal disease

         13. Malignant melanoma or history of previously treated malignant melanoma.

         14. Prohibited medications taken (including any drug known to have potential retino-toxic
             effects taken in the prior 12 months; neuroleptics taken within prior 6 months, MAO
             inhibitors except rasagiline or selegiline taken within prior 3 months, beta-blockers
             taken to treat Parkinson's disease in the prior 30 days, and Coenzyme Q10 taken
             within 14 days)

         15. Albinism/Albinoidism of any degree, type or syndrome

         16. History of glaucoma with or without treatment

         17. Inherited or acquired retinopathy such as age-related macular degeneration with
             visual loss

         18. Sarcoidosis

         19. Diabetes mellitus of any degree even if diet or insulin controlled

         20. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of less than 20/40 by ETDRS
