  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease was defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of
      stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Many drugs used for the
      treatment of GERD such as omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) which is widely used
      anti-ulcer drug and has been demonstrated to protect against esophageal mucosal injury.
      Melatonin has been found to protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from oxidative damage caused
      by reactive oxygen species in different experimental ulcer models. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the role of exogenous melatonin in the treatment of reflux disease in human
      either alone and in combination with omeprazole therapy.
