    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe.

      The aim of this research study is to compare the efficacy (reduction in HbA1c and in blood
      glucose levels) of insulin detemir, insulin aspart and biphasic insulin aspart 30, when
      added to current OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      and to verify the safety of use (number and severity of episodes of hypoglycaemia, body
      weight and side effects).

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Two participant counts are listed. The first is the percentage of total participants who achieved the target (HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%) at Month 12. The second is the percentage of subset of participants who achieved the target and did not have either minor or major hypoglycaemic episode within the four weeks prior to the month 12 exam. Minor hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was unable to treat her/himself.</description>

    <description>Rate of hypoglycaemic events was calculated as the median number of events per participant per year, defined as grade 1 (symptoms only), 2 (minor) and 3 (major). Symptoms only if self-measured plasma glucose level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or more. Minor (grade 2) if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major (grade 3) if unable to treat her/himself. Rates are reported for all participants and for the subset of participants who achieved target HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score (EQ5D) is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome in medical research. Responses can be used to generate a single numerical value associated with a given health state. The scale of values is graded from -0.59 to 1.00, with lower scores indicating a poorer health status. A score of 0 represents no quality of life and scores less than 0 represent states perceived by the respondent to be worse than death.</description>

    <description>Individually adjusted insulin detemir injected subcutaneously once daily before bed and administered in combination with current OAD treatment. Subjects had the option to add a second pre-breakfast basal insulin analogue injection if pre-breakfast but not pre-dinner meal plasma glucose targets were met. In the second and third years, a second insulin formulation was added if subjects failed to achieve or to maintain good glycaemic control, defined as two consecutive HbA1c measurements exceeding 6.5% or a single measurement exceeding 7.5%. Subjects randomised to insulin detemir once (or twice) daily were asked to add insulin aspart three times daily with meals i.e. a basal-bolus insulin analogue regimen.</description>

          <title>Insulin Detemir (Basal Insulin)</title>
          <description>Individually adjusted insulin detemir injected subcutaneously once daily before bed and administered in combination with current OAD treatment. At week 24 and thereafter, if two consecutive measurements of HbA1c were at least 8%, or one measurement of HbA1c was at least 10% the subject was deemed to have unacceptable hyperglycaemia and a second insulin formulation was added. Subjects had the option to add a second pre-breakfast basal insulin analogue injection if pre-breakfast but not pre-dinner meal plasma glucose targets were met. In the second and third years, a third insulin formulation was added if subjects failed to achieve or to maintain good glycaemic control, defined as two consecutive HbA1c measurements exceeding 6.5% or a single measurement exceeding 7.5%. Subjects randomised to insulin detemir once (or twice) daily were asked to add insulin aspart three times daily with meals i.e. a basal-bolus insulin analogue regimen</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants (Total Participants and the Subset of Participants Who Did Not Have an Hypoglycaemic Episode) Achieving a Month 12 Value in HbA1c Below or Equal to 6.5%</title>
        <description>Two participant counts are listed. The first is the percentage of total participants who achieved the target (HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%) at Month 12. The second is the percentage of subset of participants who achieved the target and did not have either minor or major hypoglycaemic episode within the four weeks prior to the month 12 exam. Minor hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was unable to treat her/himself.</description>

            <description>Individually adjusted biphasic insulin aspart 30 injected subcutaneously twice daily with meals (breakfast and dinner) and administered in combination with current OAD treatment. At week 24 and thereafter, if two consecutive measurements of HbA1c were at least 8%, or one measurement of HbA1c was at least 10% the subject was deemed to have unacceptable hyperglycaemia and a second insulin formulation was added. In the second and third years, a third insulin formulation was added if subjects failed to achieve or to maintain good glycaemic control, defined as two consecutive HbA1c measurements exceeding 6.5% or a single measurement exceeding 7.5%. Subjects randomised to biphasic insulin aspart twice daily were asked to add insulin aspart at lunchtime (midday) i.e. an augmented pre-mixed insulin analogue regimen</description>

            <title>Percentage of Participants (Total Participants and the Subset of Participants Who Did Not Have an Hypoglycaemic Episode) Achieving a Month 12 Value in HbA1c Below or Equal to 6.5%</title>
            <description>Two participant counts are listed. The first is the percentage of total participants who achieved the target (HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%) at Month 12. The second is the percentage of subset of participants who achieved the target and did not have either minor or major hypoglycaemic episode within the four weeks prior to the month 12 exam. Minor hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was unable to treat her/himself.</description>

            <description>Rate of hypoglycaemic events was calculated as the median number of events per participant per year, defined as grade 1 (symptoms only), 2 (minor) and 3 (major). Symptoms only if self-measured plasma glucose level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or more. Minor (grade 2) if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major (grade 3) if unable to treat her/himself. Rates are reported for all participants and for the subset of participants who achieved target HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%.</description>

        <description>The EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score (EQ5D) is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome in medical research. Responses can be used to generate a single numerical value associated with a given health state. The scale of values is graded from -0.59 to 1.00, with lower scores indicating a poorer health status. A score of 0 represents no quality of life and scores less than 0 represent states perceived by the respondent to be worse than death.</description>

            <description>The EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score (EQ5D) is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome in medical research. Responses can be used to generate a single numerical value associated with a given health state. The scale of values is graded from -0.59 to 1.00, with lower scores indicating a poorer health status. A score of 0 represents no quality of life and scores less than 0 represent states perceived by the respondent to be worse than death.</description>
