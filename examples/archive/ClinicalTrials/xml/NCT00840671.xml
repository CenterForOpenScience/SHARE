  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It should be shown that Cerebrolysin in combination with Alteplase, the medication that
      should recover the blood flow through the brain, is an effective and save medication to
      treat ischeamic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current trial should evaluate a combined treatment using Cerebrolysin immediately after
      thrombolysis to guarantee that the neurotrophic components are able to reach the endangered
      brain areas efficiently. An early start of treatment should guarantee rescue of most of the
      neurons reducing the overall damage.The study follows the design of pure thrombolytic trials
      to investigate, if the early neuroprotective treatment with Cerebrolysin is able to improve
      the overall outcome of patients at the day 90 evaluation visit. Due to the initial findings
      special emphasis will be also put on analysing the speed of recovery.

          -  If female, patient must not be pregnant

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke causing a measurable neurological deficit
             defined as impairment of language, motor function, cognition and/or gaze,vision or
             neglect. Ischemic stroke is defined as an event characterized by the sudden onset of
             an acute focal neurologic deficit presumed to be due to cerebral ischemia after CT
             scan excludes haemorrhage.

          -  Onset of symptoms within 3 hours prior to initiation of rt-PA administration.

          -  Stroke symptoms are to be present for at least 30 minutes and have not significantly
             improved before treatment. Symptoms must be distinguishable from an episode of
             generalized ischemia (i.e. syncope), seizure or migraine disorder.

          -  Patient is willing to participate voluntarily and to sign a written patient informed
             consent. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient or the subject's legally
             authorized representative or relatives, or deferred where applicable, according to
             the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country.

          -  Patients who are unable to sign but who are able to understand the meaning of

             voluntarily and must be able to understand an explanation of the contents of the
