A total of 12 patients\n      randomized, 6 to phenytoin and 6 to placebo treatment group. There were 2 phases in this\n      10-day inpatient study. Phase 1 subjects underwent one cocaine self-admin session.\n      Randomization took place at the start of Phase 2, Day 4 where subjects received either\n      placebo or phenytoin. The subjects assigned to phenytoin treatment received an oral loading\n      dose (20mg/kg) aimed at achieving plasma phenytoin concentration of (10-20 mg/L). During\n      Phase 2, subjects had the opportunity to self-administer cocaine on Days 5, 7, and 9. The\n      plasma phenytoin levels were expected to decrease gradually during Phase 2 which provided an\n      opportunity to study the effect of decreasing phenytoin plasma concentrations on cocaine\n      self-administration."
