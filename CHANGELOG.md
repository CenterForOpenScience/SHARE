# [25.0.0] - 2025-01-06
- update calendar version to `25`, reset semantic versions to `0`
- trove-search api:
  - support jsonapi `fields[TYPE]` query params; see https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets
  - when `TYPE` in `fields[TYPE]` matches the value of a `cardSearchFilter[resourceType]` query param,
    interpret the given fields as shorthand property-paths and use for custom csv/tsv columns
  - streaming "simple json" rendering (`acceptMediatype=application/json`)
  - when sorting by integer values, treat missing values as zero
    (tho there may be future times this is wrong...)

# [24.7.0] - 2024-12-27

  - /vocab/2023/trove/...

# [23.3.0] - 2023-10-24
- allow adding propertypaths to `cardSearchText` and `valueSearchText`
  - e.g. `cardSearchText[creator.name]=...`
- anywhere a set of propertypaths is encoded in query params, allow
  simple glob-paths ("*", "*.*", "*.*.*") that match any propertypath
  of the given length
  - note: partial globs (e.g. "*.name" or "publisher.*") are not
    supported (...yet?)
- when an iri value returned by an index-value-search has a full
  index-card, include that index-card instead of the stub built from
  indexed values
- friendlier FeatureFlag admin list

# [23.2.0] - 2023-10-09
- BREAKING: allow multiple propertypaths in query params
  - use `.` to delimit steps in a path; e.g. `creator.affiliation`
    is a path of two steps (previously would be `creator,affiliation`)

    would be two paths (previously impossible)
  - hidden behind feature flag: `periodic_propertypaths`
- add missing OSFMAP shorthands

- remove `trove_indexcard` (fully replaced by `trove_indexcard_flats`)
- `trove_indexcard_flats` updates:
  - log search queries when in DEBUG mode
  - disable "unnamed filter values" aggregations (expensive and yet unused)

# [23.1.4] - 2023-08-24
- fix: `trove_indexcard_flats` would clobber some iri values while flattering
- skip indexing cards that don't have `osfmap_json`
- more gracefully handle erroneously circular `skos:Concept` hierarchies

# [23.1.3] - 2023-08-23
- lil optimization to skip unhelpful aggregations
- disable tests using elasticsearch5 on github actions
  - (will soon reenable or remove elastic5 altogether)

# [23.1.2] - 2023-08-23
- add `trove_indexcard_flats` index strategy
    - copy of `trove_indexcard` with flatter queries (and more info on the root doc)
- fix: allow more than 11 related properties on an `index-card-search` to have non-zero count

# [23.1.1] - 2023-08-23
- small improvements to `trove_indexcard` index strategy
    - skip indexing metadata with `osfmap:contains` in the path (don't index file metadata with its container)
    - better consolidate `nested_iri` to reduce number of nested docs

# [23.1.0] - 2023-08-22
- introducing "trove"
  - store metadata records as small rdf documents called "index cards"
  - ingest rdf
  - add iri-centric search
- "shtrove": working to preserve back-compat (because trove may be trouble)

# [23.0.6] - 2023-05-11
- make `SourceConfig.disabled` prevent `harvest` tasks running

# [23.0.5] - 2023-05-11
- downgrade to python 3.10 (for now)
- improve logging
    - replace `raven` (deprecated) with `sentry-sdk`
    - add logging formatter for json with `severity` (for logging in deployments)
- remove squashed migrations, dead code

# [23.0.4] - 2023-05-05
- fix a typo

# [23.0.3] - 2023-05-05
- admin interface: allow re-ingesting all data for a source config
    (see "ingest" buttons at `/admin/share/sourceconfig/`)
- address possible cause of some backfill gaps
- fix logging errors

# [23.0.0] - 2023-05-03
- upgrade to python 3.11
- upgrade to elasticsearch 8
- add `share.search.index_strategy` to act as a slippery abstraction layer between search-engine backend and planned friendly search api
  - configure two index strategies (and make it easy to add more in the future):
    - `sharev2_elastic5`: the existing/legacy SHAREv2 search index as exists on elasticsearch5 and exposed via `/api/v2/search/creativeworks/_search`
    - `sharev2_elastic8`: a mirror/replacement for `sharev2_elastic5` with all the same `_source` docs (but possible incompatibilities for the existing pass-thru api)
- add a happy-path index-backfill workflow to the admin interface at `/admin/search-indexes`
  - when changing index-strategy settings/mappings/whatever, the "happy path" is to create, backfill, verify a new copy of the index; then switch which is used for searching, verify again, and finally delete the old index.
  - not intended to have the power of a full elasticsearch management interface -- just enough visibility to see whether things are going ok and where to start looking if something goes wrong
- for testing, support `indexStrategy` query param to `/api/v2/search/creativeworks/_search`, `/api/feeds/rss`, `/api/feeds/atom`
  - may request a configured strategy (e.g. `indexStrategy=sharev2_elastic8`) or a specific version of an index within a strategy (e.g. `indexStrategy=sharev2_elastic8__bcaa90e8fa8a772580040a8edbedb5f727202d1fca20866948bc0eb0e935e51f`)
- add `FeatureFlag` model, use it to switch default search strategy (`name="elastic_eight_default"`)

# [22.0.1] - 2022-08-29
- add `suid` value to `sharev2_elastic` index

# [21.2.1] - 2021-05-25
- fix: oai_dc formatter breaks on deletions

# [21.2.0] - 2021-05-25
- big rend! remove many things:
  - concepts:
    - merging data from multiple sources together (aiming instead for a simple,
      robust repository of metadata records -- let's talk later/soon about how
      we might do merging well)
  - models:
    - `ShareObject` and all its descendents
    - `ShareObjectVersion` and all its descendents
    - `Change`
    - `ChangeSet`
    - `SubjectTaxonomy`
    - `UnusedCeleryProviderTask`
    - `UnusedCeleryTask`
  - api routes:
    - all auto-generated `ShareObject` routes (e.g. `/api/v2/creativeworks/`)
    - all `schema` routes (except the root `/api/v2/schema/`)
      - auto-generated schema routes (e.g. `/api/v2/schema/disputes/`)
      - work type hierarchy (`/api/v2/schema/creativeworks/hierarchy/`)
    - `/api/v2/graph/`
- admin features/improvements
  - add FormattedMetadataRecord admin
  - when investigating a problem, start by finding the suid and navigate
    relationships from there
  - add action to delete all FormattedMetadataRecords for some chosen suid(s)
    (good for spam control)

# [21.1.4] - 2021-05-17
- fix a 500 error at `/api/v2/`
- fix sending useful debugging info to sentry

- fix admin bug -- don't hide the search box
- add django-debug-toolbar to dev dependencies

# [21.1.1] - 2021-05-04
- tidy up some admin inefficiencies

  - `/api/v2/formattedmetadatarecords/`
  - `/api/v2/sourceconfigs/`
  - `/api/v2/suids/`
- add new atom/rss feeds that get results from the new backcompat index
  - `/api/v2/feeds/atom/`
  - `/api/v2/feeds/rss/`
  - (old feeds now deprecated, will be gone with ShareObject)

# [21.0.8] - 2021-04-01
- add `--pls-reingest` arg to format_metadata_records command

# [21.0.7] - 2021-04-01
- fix: facility != funder (in gov.clinicaltrials transformer)

# [21.0.6] - 2021-04-01
- remove feature: oai_dc formatter no longer puts first author last
- add utility: `share.util.names.get_related_agent_name` for consistently
  getting an agent name from an "agent-work relation" node 
  - if missing both `cited_as` and `name` (true of some old, unregulated
    production data), reluctantly apply some cultural assumptions and build a
    name from parts (`given_name`, `additional_name`, `family_name`, `suffix`)

# [21.0.5] - 2021-03-12
- bugfix: in share.util.graph, handle merging nodes with dictionary values
- bugfix: when formatting oai_dc, strip characters illegal in XML
- when regulating, discard gravatars as agent identifiers

# [21.0.4] - 2021-03-11

# [21.0.3] - 2021-03-10
- fix up `populate_osf_suids` with more useful messaging
- improve "central node" guessing to handle old osf data on prod

# [21.0.2] - 2021-03-09
- speed up `populate_osf_suids` -- exclude `NormalizedData` with null `raw`,
  since they'll be ignored anyway

# [21.0.1] - 2021-03-09
- fix `populate_osf_suids` script to handle fun situations

# [21.0.0] - 2021-03-09
- new model: `FormattedMetadataRecord`
- new sharectl commands:
    - `sharectl search purge`
    - `sharectl search setup <index_name>`
    - `sharectl search setup --initial`
    - `sharectl search set_primary <index_name>`
    - `sharectl search reindex_all_suids <index_name>`
- new management commands:
    - `format_metadata_records`
    - `populate_osf_suids`
- new doc: `README-docker-quickstart.md` -- the easy way to get started
- define the "share schema" statically (in `share.schema`)
    - stop inferring everything from the `ShareObject` models
- add a parallel ingestion path, preparing for a future without `ShareObject`
    - use only the most recent `NormalizedData` for each suid (no merging)
    - allow explicitly stating the suid when pushing a `NormalizedData`
        - if not specified, try looking for an OSF guid
    - build a `FormattedMetadataRecord` for each metadata format
    - currently two metadata formatters (and room for more):
        - `sharev2_elastic`: for a back-compatible elasticsearch index -- builds
          a document just like `share.search.fetchers.CreativeWorkFetcher`, but
          from a `NormalizedData` instead of all the `ShareObject` tables
        - `oai_dc`: dublin core XML, for the OAI-PMH feed
- indexer daemon overhaul
    - assorted cleanup; dead/useless code removal
    - add `ElasticManager` to encapsulate all requests sent to elasticsearch
    - add `IndexSetup` concept to describe how to get/build documents for an
      index and what messages to send to that index's daemon
    - currently two index setups:
        - `share_classic`: index by `AbstractCreativeWork` id, using existing
          `share.search.fetchers` logic
        - `postrend_backcompat`: index by `SourceUniqueIdentifier` id, using
          the `sharev2_elastic` `FormattedMetadataRecord`s
- add a parallel OAI-PMH that uses `FormattedMetadataRecord` with `oai_dc`
    - remains dormant for the moment -- enable with `pls_trove` query param
    - NOTE: when we switch over, OAI-PMH datestamps will all be new and recent
- admin updates:
    - search `IngestJob` by suid value
