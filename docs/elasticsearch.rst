Elasticsearch
=============

SHARE has an elasticsearch API endpoint that can be used for searching SHARE's normalized data, as well as for compiling
summary statistics and analyses of the completeness of data from the various sources.

Fields Indexed by Elasticsearch
###############################

Elasticsearch can be used to search the following fields in the normalized data::

    'title'
    'language'
    'subject'
    'description'
    'date'
    'date_created'
    'date_modified
    'date_updated'
    'date_published'
    'tags'
    'links'
    'awards'
    'venues'
    'sources'
    'contributors'


Accessing the Search API
########################

Using curl
**********

You can acess the API via the command line using a basic query string with curl::

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{
        "query": {
            "query_string" : {
                "query" : "test"
            }
        }
    }' http://localhost:8000/api/search/abstractcreativework/_search

The elasticsearch API also allows you to aggregate over the whole dataset. This query will also return an aggregation of which sources
do not have a value specified for the field "language"::


    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{
        "aggs": {
            "sources": {
                "significant_terms": {
                    "percentage": {},
                    "size": 0,
                    "min_doc_count": 1,
                    "field": "sources"
                }
            }
        },
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "must_not": [
                    {
                        "exists": {
                            "field": "language"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }' http://localhost:8000/api/search/abstractcreativework/_search

sharepa - SHARE Parsing and Analysis Library
********************************************

You can also use ``sharepa`` - a python library for parsing SHARE data that connects directly to the search API. It is based on the
`elasticsearch DSL  <http://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Install sharepa with::

    pip install sharepa

You can see the `source code for sharepa on GitHub  <https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/sharepa>`_.

See some tutorials on how to use sharepa by visiting `this repository on GitHub  <https://github.com/erinspace/share_tutorials>`_.
