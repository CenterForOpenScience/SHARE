decide/create rdf-based core metadata application profile
("osf/rdf"?) allowing for additional future terms/vocabularies
==> to start, use dcterms and assume just the core

build rdf vocabulary in share/schema/
- one path: add rdf uri to each term in schema-spec.yml,
  give rdflib what it needs to parse v2normalizeddata directly
- another path: define just the target vocabulary, build a formatter
  that converts from normalizeddata to the target vocab,
  use that in metadata formatters instead of normalizeddata
  

replace share.utils.graph.MutableGraph with rdflib.Graph
(or make it use rdflib.Graph internally)

add converter from sharev2_normalizeddata to osf/rdf

update metadata formatters to take osf/rdf graph as input




=======

existing ingest flow:
  share:RawDatum -> [Transform] -> [Regulate] -> share:MutableGraph -> [Format] -> Set<share:FormattedMetadataRecord>

desired ingest flow:
  share:RawDatum -> [Parse] -> rdf:Graph (saved as share:MetadataRecord) -> [Format] -> Set<share:FormattedMetadataRecord>
