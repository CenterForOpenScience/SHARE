DONE
- browse-by-pid
  - /browse///<pid-uri>
  - render rdf-graph to html
  - link uri-refs to browse
- rdf 'push' endpoint
  - /push///<pid-uri>
- add SourceUniqueIdentifier.described_resource_pid
  - a suid identifies a metadata record in a remote repository, this is an
    ostensibly-persistent uri of the resource described by that record
- add RawDatum.contenttype (nullable text)
  - if present, should be an iana media type to extract or parse as RDF
    (e.g. "text/turtle", "application/ld+json")
- replace sharev2 "normalize" with rdf extraction
  - add NormalizedData.serialized_rdfgraph (to replace NormalizedData.data)
  - conversion from sharev2 MutableGraph to rdflib.Graph
- system-load dcterms vocabulary
- tidy migrations
- get rid of "format as deleted"
  - delete FMRs that should be removed from the index
  - indexer daemon interprets lack of FMR accordingly


TODO
- index records by their referenced uris:
  - "central" pid
  - any related pid
  - rdf predicate uri
  - rdf namespace/vocabulary/prefix uri
- recognize Source.home_page as pid for source info
- rdf-based formatters
  - oai_dc
  - sharev2_elastic
- 'push' permissions
  - authorize a Source for specific pid domains?
- browse-by-pid attention-to-detail
- generalize system-loaded vocab
- rename NormalizedData to ResourceDescription?
