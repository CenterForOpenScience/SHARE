  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the validation of a novel gait assessment method implemented in the
      Lokomat gait trainer with respect to established clinical gait assessment methods. The
      walking assessment method is based on the progressive reduction of the support of the
      device. The outcome measures of this algorithm will be the support needed in the different
      gait phases (guidance force of hip and knee joints) and the support required to the body
      weight support system (unloading). The hypothesis is that the guidance force and the support
      of the device will converge to a profile individual for each subject that is representative
      of one's impairment in the different gait phases. The reliability of the method will be
      tested collecting data from two sessions of Lokomat training. The validity of the method
      will be tested comparing the outcome of the assessment task with established clinical
      walking assessment measures.
