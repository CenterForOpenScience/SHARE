        Biological networks contribute effectively to unveil the complex structure of molecular
        interactions and to discover driver genes especially in cancer context. It can happen that
        due to gene mutations, as for example when cancer progresses, the gene expression network
        undergoes some amount of local

        ised re-wiring. The ability to detect statistical relevant changes in the interaction patterns
        induced by the progression of the disease can lead to discovery of novel relevant signatures.
        Several procedures have been recently proposed to detect sub-network differences in pairwise labeled
        weighted networks. In this paper, we propose an improvement over the state-of-the-art based on the
        Generalized Hamming Distance adopted for evaluating the topological difference between two networks
        and estimating its statistical significance. The proposed procedure exploits a more effective model
        selection criteria to generate p-values for statistical significance and is more efficient in terms
        of computational time and prediction accuracy than literature methods. Moreover, the structure of
        the proposed algorithm allows for a faster parallelized implementation. In the case of dense random
        geometric networks the proposed approach is 10-15x faster and achieves 5-10 higher AUC, Precision/Recall,
        and Kappa value than the state-of-the-art. We also report the application of the method to dissect the
        difference between the regulatory networks of IDH-mutant versus IDH-wild-type glioma cancer. In such a
        case our method is able to identify some recently reported master regulators as well as novel
        important candidates. The scripts implementing the proposed algorithms are available in R at
