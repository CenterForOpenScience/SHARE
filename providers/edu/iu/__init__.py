                    Learning management systems (LMSs) have broad adoption in higher education. Many&#13;
                    institutions are re-evaluating their LMS strategy, comparing the relative advantage of&#13;
                    alternative systems to the institution’s current LMS. As part of a selection/decision
                    process, most institutions gather instructor and student user evaluation after a
                    level of “hands-on” user experience. Gathering users’ input underscores their
                    importance and relevance to the institution’s technology decision process. Reviewing
                    publically available LMS evaluation reports, one finds no mention of any framework
                    or model used to guide the user evaluations, though common concepts occur frequently
                    across the various reports. Conversely, there is a rich tradition of technology
                    acceptance and success research, with several competing information system (IS)
                    models having been developed over the past couple decades. This paper explicates
                    the three most frequently used IS models used in LMS academic studies – the Technology
                    Acceptance Model, the IS Success Model, and the Task-Performance Chain Model. This study
                    examined the relative utility of the three models to begin to build a bridge between
                    the academic literature and the LMS selection/decision processes underway at many
                    institutions. Utilizing existing data from an LMS selection/decision process at a
                    large, public higher education institution, a qualitative analysis was conducted
                    by coding student user responses to open-ended survey question using the respective
                    models’ constructs. Quantitative analysis was conducted by first mapping closed-ended
                    survey questions to the models’ constructs and then analyzing the data with each model
                    using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicated
                    that technology acceptance and success models have considerable potential utility for
                    understanding user input in the LMS selection/decision context in higher education.
                    All three models exhibited utility in analyzing the student user evaluations from an
                    LMS pilot and contributed to the foundation for building a proposed Learning Management
                    System – Pilot Model (LMS-PM) that could provide for practitioners common nomenclature
                    and a framework for understanding and sharing LMS pilot evaluation results.
