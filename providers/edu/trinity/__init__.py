                <dc:title>A Sense of Life in Language Love and Literature</dc:title>

                <dc:description>
                    The fundamental human activity of telling stories, extended into the cultural tradition
                    of literature, leads to the creation of alternative worlds in which we find resonance with
                    the whole range of human thought and emotion from different and often conflicting perspectives.
                    Fiction has no obligation to the ordinary strictures that bind our public lives, so the
                    mind is free, engaging in literature, to become for the moment whatever imagination can
                    conceive. So we become, in fictive reality, madman and poet, sinner and saint, embrace and
                    embody sorrow and joy, hope and despair and all the rag tag feelings that flesh is heir to.
                    But the sense of our own lives bleeds into the lives of others and our characters are formed
                    and our lives enriched or impoverished by the relationships we develop. Literature extends
                    the possibilities and scope of human experience and understanding of relationships that
                    vary in dimension and depthâ€”that develop in their own ways broadly between the good, the
                    bad, and the ugly. Some relationships are given, some chosen, some forced. Some are nurturing,
                    some useful, some inspiring, some destructive. But in any event and in every instance our
                    sense of life in the connective tissue of human relationships is transformed through literature.
