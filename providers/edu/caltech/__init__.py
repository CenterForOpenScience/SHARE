                    This paper is intended to evaluate the wall effects in the pure-drag case of plane cavity
                    flow past an arbitrary body held in a closed tunnel, and to establish an accurate correction
                    rule. The three theoretical models in common use, namely, the open-wake, Riabouchinsky and
                    re-entrant-jet models, are employed to provide solutions in the form of some functional equations.
                    From these theoretical solutions several different rules for the correction of wall effects are
                    derived for symmetric wedges. These simple correction rules are found to be accurate, as compared
                    with their corresponding exact numerical solutions, for all wedge angles and for small to moderate
                    'tunnel-spacing ratio' (the ratio of body frontal width to tunnel spacing). According to these
                    correction rules, conversion of a drag coefficient, measured experimentally in a closed tunnel,
                    to the corresponding unbounded flow case requires only the data of the conventional cavitation
                    number and the tunnel-spacing ratio if based on the open-wake model, though using the Riabouchinsky
                    model it requires an additional measurement of the minimum pressure along the tunnel wall.&#13;
                    The numerical results for symmetric wedges show that the wall effects invariably result in a lower
                    drag coefficient than in an unbounded flow at the same cavitation number, and that this percentage
                    drag reduction increases with decreasing wedge angle and/or with decreasing tunnel spacing relative
                    to the body frontal width. This indicates that the wall effects are generally more significant for
                    thinner bodies in cavity flows, and they become exceedingly small for sufficiently blunt bodies.
                    Physical explanations for these remarkable  features of cavity-flow wall effects are sought; they
                    are supported by the present experimental investigation of the pressure distribution on the wetted
                    body surface as the flow parameters are varied. It is also found that the theoretical drag coefficient
                    based on the Riabouchinsky model is smaller than that predicted by the open-wake model, all the flow
                    parameters being equal, except when the flow approaches the choked state (with the cavity becoming
                    infinitely long in a closed tunnel), which is the limiting case common to all theoretical models. This
                    difference between the two flow models becomes especially pronounced for smaller wedge angles,
                    shorter cavities, and with tunnel walls farther apart.&#13;
                    In order to gauge the degree of accuracy of these theoretical models in  approximating the
                    real flows, and to ascertain the validity of the correction rules, a series of definitive
                    experiments was carefully designed to complement the theory, and then carried out in a high-speed
                    water tunnel. The measurements on a series of fully cavitating wedges at zero incidence suggest that,
                    of the theoretical models, that due to Riabouchinsky is superior throughout the range tested.
                    The accuracy of the correction rule based on that model has also been firmly established. Although
                    the experimental investigation has been limited to symmetric wedges only, this correction rule (
                    equations (85), (86) of the text) is expected to possess a general validity, at least for symmetric
                    bodies without too large curvatures, since the geometry of the body profile is only implicitly
                    involved in the correction formula. This experimental study is perhaps one of a very few with
                    the particular objective of scrutinizing various theoretical cavity-flow models.
