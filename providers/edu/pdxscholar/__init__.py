                    Research on temperature change has received attention from scientists. Not only
                    has temperature change attracted scientists who study the Earthâ€™s weather and
                    climate, but also those who study plants and animals on land and in oceans. The
                    research being conducted looks at how these temperature changes affect the anatomy
                    and physiology of organisms, but other research also studies how terrestrial and
                    aquatic ecosystems have changed and the types of responses that have occurred as
                    a result. For many years, research in terrestrial ecosystems has dominated research
                    in aquatic ecosystems. Limited research has been conducted in aquatic ecosystems
                    involving green macroalgae, which are primary producers and an essential part of
                    these ecosystems. Within the last fifteen years, research regarding the effects of
                    temperature change on green macroalgae has shown that temperature affects photosynthesis
                    and biochemistry. Overall, photosynthesis is almost completely inhibited after
                    sufficient exposure due to damage in Photosystem II. There is also a substantial
                    change in the production of chemical molecules known as reactive oxygen species
                    that caused physical damage to the algal cells as well as a change in structure
                    for proteins that is essential for function. I reviewed the literature within the
                    past fifteen years, regarding the effects of temperature on a variety of green
                    macroalgae species. The results indicated that after sufficient exposure, the
                    photosynthetic rate of macroalgae is reduced significantly and that the change in
                    chemistry lead to alterations in the physiology of green macroalgae. In this thesis,
                    I propose two possible directions for algae research that involves genetic sequencing
                    of a model speciesto identify a possible temperature tolerance gene, as well as
                    the potential use of green macroalgae in photobioreactors as a source of renewable energy.
