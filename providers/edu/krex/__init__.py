                    The physical environment influences mental health and inevitably well-being.
                    While exposure to natural environments shows salubrious health benefits among
                    those who maintain a consistent connection, little is known about how urban
                    environments impact mental health. As urbanization increases worldwide, it is
                    essential to understand the linkages between urbanized environments and public
                    health. This project is guided by the research question: How do different environmental
                    characteristics affect stress-related responses in users?&#xd;
                    The study will guide individual subjects (n > 30) to walk a designated route,
                    exposing them to different architectural and environmental elements in downtown
                    Manhattan, Kansas. Physiological biofeedback sensors, including electrodermal
                    activity (EDA) and heart rate sensors, will be used monitor physiological
                    behavioral changes; GPS will provide spatial location; and a GoPro camera will
                    provide real-time first-person experience. Data from these sensors will be
                    integrated into a temporal-spatial analysis to ascertain correlations between
                    architectural and environmental elements in space and associated stress responses.
                    Upon completing the walk, participants will take a brief survey asking for their
                    perceptions, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the different environments
                    they encounter on the walk. &#xd;
                    Raw data collected from the biofeedback devices will be refined and analyzed spatially
                    using GIS mapping software. This will allow us to visualize any associations between
                    design characteristics and the elicited behavioral responses in order to determine
                    the environmental characteristics that may illicit heightened stress responses.
                    Analysis of the survey data will seek to identify any correlations between physiological
                    and perception-based responses.&#xd;
                    The intent of the research is to provide a foundation for further studies into
                    how public policy can be better informed and augmented to mitigate potential
                    public health issues caused by urban design. Results will also inform architectural
                    and engineering decision-making processes to further improve urban design by
                    identifying characteristics that may improve or decrease mental health of those
                    living and/or frequenting urban environments.
