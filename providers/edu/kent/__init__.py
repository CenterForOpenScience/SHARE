                    Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe a substantive theory that
                    details how adolescents manage living with a parent experiencing chronic noncancer
                    pain (CNCP). Design: Grounded theory methods were used to recruit 30 young adults,
                    ages 18 through 21 years, from community settings. Methods: During open-ended interviews,
                    participants were asked to look back on their adolescence and talk about how they managed
                    living with parental chronic pain. Interview transcripts and field notes were analyzed
                    using constant comparative methods. Findings: Participants who lived with heavily
                    shrouded parents (a) endured hardships; (b) distanced themselves; (c) lamented losses;
                    and (d) held back on revealing their authentic selves. Those who lived with minimally
                    shrouded parents (a) received nurturance and parenting; (b) empathized with their
                    parents’ pain situations; (c) lamented losses; and (d) revealed to their parents
                    how parental pain affected them. Participants who connected with significant others
                    “filled the gaps” created by parental pain disability, while those who did not connect
                    with significant others “cooped up” their thoughts, feelings, and needs. Conclusions:
                    Findings shed light on psychosocial processes and behavior within families experiencing
                    CNCP and serve as the basis for the development of personalized family interventions.
                    Clinical Relevance: Nursing interventions should focus on helping adolescents and
                    parents build interpersonal relationship and communication skills. Aggressive
                    diagnosis and treatment of mood disturbance in the parent with CNCP should be part
                    of a holistic treatment plan.
