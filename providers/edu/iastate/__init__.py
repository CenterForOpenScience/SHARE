                    ABSTRACT ONTOLOGIES AND METHODS FOR INTEROPERABILITY OF ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
                    MODELS (EAMS) IN AN E-DESIGN ENVIRONMENT SEPTEMBER 2007 NEELIMA KANURI, B.S.,
                    BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCES PILANI INDIA M.S., UNIVERSITY OF
                    MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Ian Grosse Interoperability is the
                    ability of two or more systems to exchange and reuse information efficiently. This
                    thesis presents new techniques for interoperating engineering tools using ontologies
                    as the basis for representing, visualizing, reasoning about, and securely exchanging
                    abstract engineering knowledge between software systems. The specific engineering
                    domain that is the primary focus of this report is the modeling knowledge associated
                    with the development of engineering analysis models (EAMs). This abstract modeling
                    knowledge has been used to support integration of analysis and optimization tools
                    in iSIGHT FD , a commercial engineering environment. ANSYS , a commercial FEA tool,
                    has been wrapped as an analysis service available inside of iSIGHT-FD. Engineering
                    analysis modeling (EAM) ontology has been developed and instantiated to form a
                    knowledge base for representing analysis modeling knowledge. The instances of the
                    knowledge base are the analysis models of real world applications. To illustrate
                    how abstract modeling knowledge can be exploited for useful purposes, a cantilever
                    I-Beam design optimization problem has been used as a test bed proof-of-concept
                    application. Two distinct finite element models of the I-beam are available to
                    analyze a given beam design- a beam-element finite element model with potentially
                    lower accuracy but significantly reduced computational costs and a high fidelity,
                    high cost, shell-element finite element model. The goal is to obtain an optimized
                    I-beam design at minimum computational expense. An intelligent KB tool was developed
                    and implemented in FiPER . This tool reasons about the modeling knowledge to
                    intelligently shift between the beam and the shell element models during an
                    optimization process to select the best analysis model for a given optimization
                    design state. In addition to improved interoperability and design optimization,
                    methods are developed and presented that demonstrate the ability to operate on
                    ontological knowledge bases to perform important engineering tasks. One such method
                    is the automatic technical report generation method which converts the modeling
                    knowledge associated with an analysis model to a flat technical report. The second
                    method is a secure knowledge sharing method which allocates permissions to portions
                    of knowledge to control knowledge access and sharing. Both the methods acting together
                    enable recipient specific fine grain controlled knowledge viewing and sharing in an
                    engineering workflow integration environment, such as iSIGHT-FD. These methods
                    together play a very efficient role in reducing the large scale inefficiencies
                    existing in current product design and development cycles due to poor knowledge
                    sharing and reuse between people and software engineering tools. This work is a
                    significant advance in both understanding and application of integration of knowledge
                    in a distributed engineering design framework.
