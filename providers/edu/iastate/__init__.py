                    How does society define identity? How do you? How do pieces of the identity
                    puzzle such as gender, color, social class or spirituality influence our experiences?
                    Through a diverse selection of artists and media, this exhibition explores some of
                    the many ways in which identity can be empowered or marginalized, multidimensional
                    or stereotyped. The works of art presented offer different lenses through which to
                    view society. The paintings, sculptures, crafts, and other objects in this exhibition
                    embody and connect to a wide variety of social issues and perspectives to inspire
                    visitor discussion and develop critical thinking skills through visual literacy.
                    This exhibition reflects a multi-disciplinary curatorial approach to reexamining
                    the permanent collection in conjunction with the 40th Anniversary celebration of
                    University Museums. These collaborative interpretations, juxtaposed with the works
                    of art, aim at encouraging viewers to examine themselves and varying perceptions
                    of identity. The curatorial team includes Amy Bix, History; April Eisman, Art
                    History; Nancy Gebhart, University Museums; Christiana Langenberg, English; Sara
                    Marcketti, Apparel, Events, and Hospitality Management; Amy Popillion, Human
                    Development and Family Studies; Michèle Schaal, Women’s Studies and English; Jodi
                    Sterle, Animal Science; and Gloria Jones-Johnson, Sociology-LAS. This exhibition
                    is supported by the ISU Women’s and Diversity Grant Program, Michèle Schaal and
                    Jean-Philippe Tessonnier, Sara Marcketti, the Department of Apparel Events and
                    Hospitality Management, the Department of History, the Department of English, the
