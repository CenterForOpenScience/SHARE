                    We demonstrate a novel interaction between two members of the cation diffusion
                    facilitator (CDF) family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Msc2p and a newly recognized
                    CDF family member, Zrg17p. Both Msc2p and Zrg17p have been previously implicated in
                    zinc homeostasis in yeast. In particular, ZRG17 was previously identified as a zinc
                    regulated gene controlled by the zinc-responsive Zap1p transcription factor. We show
                    that both Msc2p and Zrg17p are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when
                    expressed at normal levels. Zinc deficiency in yeast induces the unfolded protein
                    response (UPR), a system normally activated by unfolded ER proteins. UPR induction
                    in low zinc is exacerbated in msc2 and zrg17 mutants. Genetic and biochemical evidence
                    indicate that this UPR induction is due to genuine ER dysfunction. Notably, ER-associated
                    protein degradation (ERAD) is defective in zinc-limited msc2 mutants. Msc2p and Zrg17p
                    physically interact, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we propose that
                    Msc2p and Zrg17p form a zinc transport complex in the ER membrane to maintain the
                    function of this compartment. Zinc deficiency also upregulates the mammalian ER stress
                    response, indicating a conserved requirement for zinc in ER function among eukaryotes.
                    Lastly, ZnT5 and ZnT6, the closest mammalian homologues to Msc2p and Zrg17p, may also
                    functionally interact, suggesting that interactions between CDF members may be a common
                    phenomenon.We demonstrate a novel interaction between two members of the cation diffusion.
