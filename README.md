# SHARE/Trove

SHARE is creating a free, open dataset of research (meta)data.

> **Note**: SHAREâ€™s open API tools and services help bring together scholarship distributed across research ecosystems for the purpose of greater discoverability. However, SHARE does not guarantee a complete aggregation of searched outputs. For this reason, SHARE results should not be used for methodological analyses, such as systematic reviews.
