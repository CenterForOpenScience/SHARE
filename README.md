SHARE/trove (aka SHARtrove, shtrove) is is a service meant to store (meta)data you wish to keep and offer openly.

note: this codebase is currently rather entangled with [osf.io](https://osf.io), which has its shtrove at https://share.osf.io/trove -- stay tuned for more-reusable open-source libraries and tools for working with (meta)data
