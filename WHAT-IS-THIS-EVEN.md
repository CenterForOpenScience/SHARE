# "What is this, even?"

Imagine a vast, public library full of the outputs and results of some scientific
research -- shelves full of articles, preprints, datasets, data analysis plans,
and so on.

You can think of SHARE/Trove as that library's card catalog.

## "...What is a card catalog?"

A card catalog is that weird, cool cabinet you might see at the front of a
library with a bunch of tiny drawers full of index cards -- each index card
contains information about some item on the library shelves.

The card catalog is where you go when you want to:
- locate a specific item in the library
- discover items related to a specific topic, author, or other keywords
- make a new item easily discoverable by others

## "How can I use it?"

You can search the full SHARE/Trove catalog at
[share.osf.io/discover](https://share.osf.io/discover).

Other search pages can also be built on SHARE/Trove, showing only a specific
collection of items. For example, [OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/discover)
and [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries/discover) show only registrations
and preprints, respectively, which are hosted on OSF infrastructure.
